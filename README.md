# Postmate (Hasura HackDev Challenge - 2018)
This application is built for the sole purpose of the [`Hasura HackDev Challenge - 2018`](https://www.hackerearth.com/sprints/hasura-hackdev-challenge/). 
This application aims to complete the challenge posed under “open” theme of Hasura HackDev Challenge. 
Based on our analysis and requirement and interaction with few developers, we opted to build a solution that will provide developers a one stop solution for querying.
Main Objectives of our solution is an application that can make life easier and more productive for a developer. To Build something that would save time and effort so that:

- There is an integrated option for the developers to post their queries.

- Focus is on maintenance of only one platform which can take care of other platforms.

- Making social sharing of queries easier.

- There is an increase in developer’s efficiency.

Hence an application which acts as a one stop solution for developer’s obstacles.

The source code can be found in the [`/src/App`](https://github.com/Team-Igneel/Postmate/tree/master/src/App) directory/folder.

The back-end APIs can be found in the [`/src/Backend/postmate`](https://github.com/Team-Igneel/Postmate/tree/master/src/Backend/postmate) folder

# Running This Project :
The minimum Android OS that you need to run this project is Lollipop (API Level 23). So, make sure you're satisfying the minimum requirements first. Otherwise, your handset won't be able to parse the apk file.

- ### Permissions Required :
    This application requires you to provide few permissions to it, in order to work properly. Here's the list of permissions that the application needs :
    - Internet Access
    - View WiFi Connections
    - Storage (Read/Write Perms For Cache)
    - Read Google Service Configuration
    
- #### Instructions For Direct APK Installation :
    If you want to run this application on your android phone, please move over to the "[`Release`](https://github.com/Team-Igneel/Postmate/releases/)" section and download the latest stable APK build for your android phone. You do not need any external libraries or application.

- #### Instructions For Developers/Testers :
     If you're a developer or any user who wishes to test this application and run this android project, it's recommended to install Visual Studio with Xamarin Support and Android SDKs on your system. Remember that Android SDKs should be in your local path for you to be able to compile the project properly. You can find the source code in the "[SOURCE](https://github.com/Team-Igneel/Postmate/tree/master/src/App)" directory.

    If you do not happen to have Visual Studio, it is recommended to get it because it'll download all the required packages on its own, if they're not present. You can use Visual Studio's Free Community Edition. It'll work, as we've developed this application on it.
But, if for some reason, you don't want to or can't install Visual Studio, you will need to have .NET, Xamarin, Android SDK and required Packages in your system's local path for you to be able to compile and execute this application project.
